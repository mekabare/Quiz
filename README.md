* Create questions with the exe, easy_questions.txt serves as guideline,
* you can also type questions manually, if you believe to keep up with the formatting
* at the very least I'd like 10 questions per tier for easy and hard, as theyre both are going to be showcased during class 


If you're able to read yourself into my code, good luck lol.
